          Thanks to science which has changed the world of Adam and Eve by its
          amazing modern (technologies/ discoveries). ..... is one of them. We
          cannot think of modern life without the gift of modern technology like
          mobile phone.
          <br />
          Internet/ Facebook/ mobile phone is a system which work without the
          help of any wire. With the help of mobile phone/ internet, we can see
          the whole world. It helps us know the economy, education, culture,
          technology and sports of other countries of the world. Using ………, we
          can send messages, play games, communicate to anyone to any distant
          places. We can be aware of different news and views, and can do many
          other activities. But there is no unmixed blessing on the earth. With
          all its usefulness, ……. has still some drawbacks in disguise. Using ……
          weakens our eye-sight and can cause diseases to the user. Terrorist
          are using it to spread violence. Most times, students prefer enjoying
          ……… to studying. Obscene scene are shown in …… . This obscene scene
          hinders the growth of the young generation.Our young generation are
          led to go astray by this obscenity. <br />
          So to say, it should be our morality to accept the good and give up
          the bad. And the government should create public awareness. However,
          …… is an indispensible part of our modern life and communication.

        <p style="text-align: justify">
          I want to be .... which is my aim in life/ future plan of life.
          Everybody should have an aim without which a man is like ship without
          a rudder. So, if a man/ student fails to choose his aim/ profession,
          he suffers in life. <br />
          I, therefore, want to be a (doctor). There are many reasons for
          choosing the profession of a doctor. Since my boyhood, it was my
          cherished desire to serve the nation. The village people in our
          country are very poor. They suffer from various diseases/problems, but
          there are few qualified, honest (doctors/Politicians) to serve them.
          Rather, the helpless people are always exploited by them. Moreover,
          the village people, being honest, are deprived of basic needs like
          medical treatment. So, it is my determination to set up a hospital
          with free distribution of medicines in my village. I have also planned
          to do some social work like repairing bridges, roads, and other
          services. Thus, I have decided to serve the nation through my
          profession.<br />

          Everyone should continue to work according to his future plan/aim. So,
          to reach my goal, I am preparing well in all subjects and hope to get
          a good score in all the exams. After completing my MBBS, I will return
          to my village to serve my villagers.<br />

          Success in life depends much on the profession, and my choice is a
          noble one. I believe that I will be able to achieve it. --- Let me
          know if there's anything else you need!

        <h3>Or, Visit to a village.</h3>
        <h3>Or, Importance of travelling/journey.</h3>
        <h3>Or, Journey by boat/train/bus that you have made recently.</h3>
        <h3>Or, a study tour/excursion that you enjoyed.</h3>

        <p>
          Education involves not only reading books and doing exercises but also
          acquiring knowledge through doing something practically. In other
          words, practical experience is a part of education. In this sense,
          traveling/journey is very important. Traveling/Journey means going
          from one place to another. By traveling, one can know the unknown,
          enjoy the unenjoyed things. <br />
          Traveling has, therefore, two purposes: acquiring experience and
          pleasure. In both cases, knowledge comes from traveling or a journey.
          Now we find traveling very easy. We can travel by bus, train, boat,
          etc. People make [such] journeys, for it is cheaper and more
          comfortable than any other journey in Bangladesh. I like this journey
          very much, and I am fond of traveling. A journey by [mode of
          transport] can be thought of as immense pleasure and experience. I
          would like to give a specific account of such a journey. It was a
          historical place named Paharpur, a remote village from Naogaon
          district. <br />

          During the summer vacation, taking financial assistance from our
          principal, we arranged this study tour/journey. We had taken enough
          food and fruit with us. It was early in the morning when we had
          started our journey. It was a sunny day. While passing through, we
          were glad to see the beautiful scenery of the rural areas. On both
          sides, we saw green fields of paddy, jute, and plants. We were caught
          by the natural beauty. But after reaching there, we were really
          overwhelmed by the architectural beauty of the relics of Buddha Vihar,
          which was built about seven hundred years ago. It reminds us of the
          maxim, "seeing is believing." <br />

          From this journey, I learned that without traveling, education remains
          incomplete and imperfect. Traveling removes the boredom and offers us
          pleasure. Therefore, we should take traveling and tours.
