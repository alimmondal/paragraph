      Thanks to science which has changed the world of Adam and Eve by its amazing modern <strong>(technologies/ discoveries/social networks)</strong> . Mobile phone/ internet/
      facebook is one of them. We cannot think of modern life without the gift
      of modern technology like mobile phone/ internet. Internet/ Facebook/
      mobile phone is a system which work without the help of any wire. With the
      help of mobile phone/ internet, we can see the whole world. It helps us
      know the economy, education, culture, technology and sports of other
      countries of the world. Using ………, we can send messages, play games,
      communicate to anyone to any distant places. We can be aware of different
      news and views, and can do many other activities. But there is no unmixed
      blessing on the earth. With all its usefulness, ……. has still some
      drawbacks in disguise. Using …… weakens our eye-sight and can cause
      diseases to the user. Terrorist are using it to spread violence. Most
      times, students prefer enjoying ……… to studying. Obscene scene are shown
      in …… . This obscene scene hinders the growth of the young generation.Our
      young generation are led to go astray by this obscenity. So to say, it
      should be our morality to accept the good and give up the bad. And the
      government should create public awareness. However, …… is an
      indispensible part of our modern life and communication.
