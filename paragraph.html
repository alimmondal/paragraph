      facebook is one of them. We cannot think of modern life without the gift
      of modern technology like mobile phone/ internet. Internet/ Facebook/

      countries of the world. Using ………, we can send messages, play games,
      communicate to anyone to any distant places. We can be aware of different
      news and views, and can do many other activities. But there is no unmixed
      blessing on the earth. With all its usefulness, ……. has still some
      drawbacks in disguise. Using …… weakens our eye-sight and can cause
      diseases to the user. Terrorist are using it to spread violence. Most

      in …… . This obscene scene hinders the growth of the young generation.Our
      young generation are led to go astray by this obscenity. So to say, it
      should be our morality to accept the good and give up the bad. And the
      government should create public awareness. However, …… is an
      indispensible part of our modern life and communication.

        Price Hike        
      </h3>
      <p>
        Price hikes have become a great concern in Bangladesh, exerting a pressure on its economy and the daily lives of its citizens. inflation, supply chain disruptions, fluctuating global commodity prices, and domestic production challenges are the causes of price hikes. The impact of price increases is felt across various sectors, affecting everything from food and fuel to healthcare and education. Vulnerable populations often bear the brunt of these hikes, as their purchasing power erodes, making it increasingly difficult to make ends meet. The government's efforts to control and mitigate these price hikes through policy interventions, subsidies, and market regulations are crucial in alleviating the burden on the populace. Long-term strategies that focus on bolstering domestic production, improving infrastructure, and a lasting economy are essential to check the bad effects of price hikes and ensuring prosperous future for Bangladesh.

It's preferable to wealth because one may have vast property but he is hated only for the absence of it. So, to maintain peace in society, we also must have it to be an ideal social being.
